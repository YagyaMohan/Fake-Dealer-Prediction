# Fake Dealer Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a dealer is **fraudulent** or **innocent** using supervised machine learning algorithms. Three classifiers are implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest Classifier  

The model is trained on an encrypted, real-world dataset provided by a tax organization. Due to the size and confidentiality of the dataset, it is not publicly shared.
